# Colors
Just copy from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp) as a note for future research.  

## Shade
## Tint
## Hue
Hue is just another word for color.  
## Value
Color value is a term for how light or dark dark a color is (from white to black).   
## Saturation
Saturation is about intensity.  
Highly saturated colors are bright. Desaturated colors have less pigment.  
## Palette

## Scheme
### [Monochromatic](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_monochromatic.asp)
Monochromatic schemes use different tones from the same angle on the color wheel (the same hue).  
Monochromatic color schemes are guaranteed to suit each other because they all come from the same family.  
### [Analogous](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_analogous.asp)
Analogous color schemes are created by using colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.  
If an analogous color scheme does not have enough contrast between the colors (for an nice website design), it can be adjusted to give it more variety.  
### [Complementary](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_complementary.asp)
Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel.  
Mostly consist of two complementary colors expanded with grey tones, tints, and shades.  
### [Triadic](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_triadic.asp)
Triadic schemes are made up of hues equally spaced around the color wheel.  
### [Compound](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_compound.asp)
Compound schemes are almost the same as complementary schemes.  
Instead of using colors that are opposites, it uses colors on both sides of the opposite hue.  

## Web color format
### RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
### HEX (Hexadecimal)
Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.  
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB.  
RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.  
For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.  
### HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.  
HSL color values are specified with: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).  
### HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness)

### CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
CMYK colors is a combination of CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW , and BLACK.  
Computer screens display colors using RGB color values. Printers often presents colors using CMYK color values.
