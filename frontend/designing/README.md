## Scheme
### [Monochromatic](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_monochromatic.asp)
Monochromatic schemes use different tones from the same angle on the color wheel (the same hue).  
Monochromatic color schemes are guaranteed to suit each other because they all come from the same family.  
### [Analogous](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_analogous.asp)
Analogous color schemes are created by using colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.  
If an analogous color scheme does not have enough contrast between the colors (for an nice website design), it can be adjusted to give it more variety.  
### [Complementary](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_complementary.asp)
Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel.  
Mostly consist of two complementary colors expanded with grey tones, tints, and shades.  
### [Triadic](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_triadic.asp)
Triadic schemes are made up of hues equally spaced around the color wheel.  
### [Compound](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_compound.asp)
Compound schemes are almost the same as complementary schemes.  
Instead of using colors that are opposites, it uses colors on both sides of the opposite hue.
